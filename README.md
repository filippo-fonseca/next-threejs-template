# üå≥ ThreeJS Template for NextJS

A starter template for building [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) WebGL-based applications with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) & server-side rendering (SSR).

## TypeScript

If you'd like to convert this project to use TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript, follow this short [article](https://dev.to/filippofonseca/how-to-set-up-a-next-js-project-with-typescript-and-react-576h) I wrote. It's really simple and should take less than 2 minutes with NextJS.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository to get started and `cd` into the folder (feel free to rename it to your liking):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:filippo-fonseca/next-threejs-template.git

cd next-threejs-template
```

Next, install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm i
```

**NOTE:** You can use either Yarn or npm, although it is recommended to use Yarn for this project (as it is the standard for NextJS-based projects).

Lastly, let's run the development server!

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The following starter page should be rendered on the screen with a green cube animation, as such:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pXNv0vv/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-11-28-57.png" />

You can now start editing the page and your app by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. Feel free to make it your own.
